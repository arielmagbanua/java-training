# FizzBuzz

Let’s play a game of FizzBuzz! It’s quite the same with your childhood "PopCorn" game, but with a little bit of twist to align it with programming.

Instructions:

* Input a positive integer in one line. This will serve as the ending point of your loop.
Loop from 1 to the ending point (inclusive) and perform the following statements:
    * If the number is only divisible by 3, print `Fizz`.
    * If the number is only divisible by 5, print `Buzz`.
    * If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.
    * If nothing is true in the previous conditions, skip the number.

Test cases:

```shell
15
Fizz
Buzz
Fizz
Fizz
Buzz
Fizz
FizzBuzz
```
