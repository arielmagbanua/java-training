# The was a Three

I'm bored with just basic counting. How about we do some complex things this time? But I don't want to be associated with any number that's not divisible by 3.

Instructions:

* Print out all numbers from 1 to 100 that is divisible by 3, each in separate lines, using a for() loop.

Test cases:

```shell
3
6

18
21

30
33
36
39
