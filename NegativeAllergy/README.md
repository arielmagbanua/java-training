# Negative Allergy

Whole numbers are great, but I think we should also pay attention to decimal numbers, too.
So, how about we make a program that involves a lot of decimals?

Instructions:

* Continuously ask for floating point values (decimal numbers) using the doâ€¦while() loop, sum them all up, and store the total into one variable.
* The loop shall only terminate for the following reasons:
    * A negative decimal number is inputted (but still included in the total sum).
    * The total sum reaches 100.0 or more.

Test cases:

```shell
1.77 
1.33
2.9
-1.3
4.70
```

```shell
1.1
1.2
1.3
1.4
-1.0
4.00
```

```shell
90.5
2.5
90.5
183.50
```
