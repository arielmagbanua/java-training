# Security Check

Woah there, what are you doing roaming around past the curfew? I'm going to have to ask for some identification.

Instructions:

* Input an integer. This will represent your age.
* If the inputted age is greater than or equal to 18, print out `Adult`. Otherwise, print `Minor`.

Test cases:

```shell
20
Adult

15
Minor
```
