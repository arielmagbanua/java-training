# Factorials

For those of you who may not now, a factorial is a product of multiplying from 1 until the number. Now, you must make a program that will accept an integer and then print out its factorial using loops.

Instructions:

* Input a positive integer.
* Using a for() loop, generate the factorial value of the integer and print out the result.

Test cases:

```shell
5
120
```

```shell
0
1
```
