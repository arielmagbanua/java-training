# Body Mass Index Version 2.0

Recall that according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health,
body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
It is used to monitor one's health by determining whether one is underweight, overweight, has normal weight or is obese.
It is computed based as follows (when using standard weight in pounds and height in inches):

BMI = 703 x (weight/(height<sup>2</sup>))

Furthermore, people with BMI scores that are less than 18.5 are said to be underweight.
Those with scores between 18.5–24.9 (inclusive) are of normal weight.
Those with scores between 25–29.9 (inclusive) are said to be overweight.
And those with scores 30 or higher are obese.

Instructions:

* The input is composed of two positive integers representing the weight in pounds and the height in inches.
* A single line containing two values: the computed BMI with 1 decimal place and whether the score represents underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Test cases:

```shell
