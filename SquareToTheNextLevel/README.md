# Square To The Next Level

We've already tried printing out the values of an array in reversed order, right? Today, we shall compute the squares of all the numbers.

Instructions:

* There's already a predefined array/list containing 100 integer values. Loop through each value, compute their squares, and display them.

Test cases:

```shell
89
324
3481
289 
8100
6724
196 
784
