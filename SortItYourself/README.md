# Sort It Yourself

A descending order means values arranged from largest to smallest.
But in your case, you're going to have to sort these integers in ascending order, which means from smallest to largest.

Instructions:

* Input three integers.
* Print the integers in ascending order using your knowledge on conditional statements.

Test cases:

```shell
6 1 3
1 3 5

2 0 1
0 1 2
```
