# A Shorter Three

Numbers in threes are awesome! But the one last time was too lengthy to look at, so I just want to view it in a shorter but still readable format.

Instructions:

* Print out all numbers from 1 to 100 that is divisible by 3 using a for loop just like the last problem, but this time, with each number only separated by the space like that of the sample output.

Test cases:

```shell
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 54 57 60 63 66 69 72 75 78 81 84 87 90 93 96 99
```
