# The FizzBuzz Game

Let's play a game of FizzBuzz! It works just like the popular childhood game "PopCorn", but with rules of math applied since math is fun, right?
Just print out `Fizz` when the given number is divisible by 3, `Buzz` when it's divisible by 5, and `FizzBuzz` when it's divisible by both 3 and 5!

Instructions:
