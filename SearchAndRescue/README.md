# Search and Rescue

Make a program that will accept an integer and loop for the same number of times as that of the inputted integer and input random integers and add it to the array/list one by one, per line. Afterwards, make your program accept another random integer.
Using that final integer, compare from your array/list if the final integer's value is also present in your current array/list. If so, print "Present"; otherwise, print "None".

Instructions:

* The first line contains the size of the array/list.
* The next lines contain the integers.
* The last line contains an integer to be searched.

Test cases:

```shell
5
3
21
2
5
23
2
Present
```

```shell
4
3
2
22
-10
100
None
```
