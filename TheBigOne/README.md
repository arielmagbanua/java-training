# Square To The Next Level

Remember that time when we tried identifying the largest digit among the given integer? Well, let's take it to the next level, and figure out the same thing on arrays/lists!
Let's do this one more time!

Instructions:

* Create a variable that accepts a positive integer.
* Create an empty array. Then, using loops, add random integer values into the array one by one. The number of values to be stored is dependent on the inputted positive integer given in the first instruction.
* Print out the largest integer among all the elements in the array, by any means necessary.

Test cases:

```shell
5
5
34
3
23
10
```
