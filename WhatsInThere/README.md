# What's In There

Let's try defining the size of the list and create the contents of it on our own! And then, to give off a sense of excitement, let's try accessing the value of a list element in a random index position!
Let's do this fast!

Instructions:

* The first line contains an integer n which is the size of the array.
* The next n lines contains a string on each.
* The last line contains an integer which is the index to be accessed and printed.
