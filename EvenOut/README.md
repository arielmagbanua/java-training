# Even Out

You know, I was lying when I said the last time that numbers associated with 3 are my favorite, because the one I actually like the most in the world are even numbers! But to make things harder for you, you have to pick the even numbers from a range of two given numbers.

Instructions:

* Input two integers in one line, separated by a space. The first integer shall represent the starting point, and the other, the ending point.
* Print out all even numbers that are within the range of the starting and ending point (inclusive or including the ending point).

Test cases:

```shell
5 10
6 8 10

10 25
10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24
```
