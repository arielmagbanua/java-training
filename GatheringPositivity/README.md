# Gathering Positivity

I always want to look at the positive side of things, so I decide to seriously look at positive numbers, too!

Will you code along with me?

Instructions:

* Using the doâ€¦while() loop, continuously scan for integers, but add up only all the positive integers and store the total in one variable.
* The loop shall only be terminated when the inputted integer is zero. Afterwards, print out the total of all inputted positive integers.

Test cases:

```shell
2
3 
4
-19
5
0
14
```
